# toolnut
Toolnut is the little script designed to speed up the set-up process after installing Linux(Ubuntu, to be more specific) or encourage newbies to start their journey into the world of Linux. It is capable of updating the system, keeping it optimized, and installing the most commonly used software, scripts, and other related things. Future support for GUI and manuals are planned.
